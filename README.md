# TelecomManagerConsoleProj

<h1><i>!!README FILE IS WIP</i>!!</h1>

 * The application is just a test for c# and .net learning, the goal will be to work with as many functionality and algorithm as possible.
 * This isn't a professional software nor is it the goal, it will surely be messy as hell, but i will try to clean it after working with each functionality.
 
 * The App will help manage a hypothetical telecom company service.
 
 *This idea came to me because of my experience working as a Customer Service Agent for a big telecom company here in quebec. Since i know the core concept behind the account management this should be a fun experience to work on. And it even let me the opportunity to work on a lot of .net or other API/Tech functionality.
 
 * THE APP IS MADE COMPLETELY IN CONSOLE.
 * The UI will be I/O in the said console.
 
 * First: the information will be localy store in a text file like: XML, JSON, Text -> the operator will have choices when selecting the Save or Export option.
 * Second: The information will be linked to a relational database(MySQL) and with a NOSQL DB(I will use MongoDB here)
